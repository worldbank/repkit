d 'IETOOLKIT': module providing commands specially developed for Impact Evaluations
d 
d  ietookit provides a set of commands that address different
d aspects of data management and data analysis in relation to
d Impact Evaluations. The list of commands will be extended
d continuously, and suggestions on new commands are highly
d appreciated. Some of the commands are related to standardized
d practices developed at the World Bank’s unit for Impact
d Evaluations (DIME) and might not apply to practices adopted at
d other institutions. For these commands, the corresponding help
d files provide justifications for the standardized practices
d applied. ieduplicates and iecompdup are useful tools to identify
d and correct for duplicates. iebaltab is a tool for multiple
d treatment arm balance tables. ieboilstart standardizes the
d boilerplate code at the top of all do-files. iegraph produces
d graphs based on common impact evaluation regression models. See
d https://github.com/worldbank/ietoolkit for more details.

d 'FTOOLS': module to provide alternatives to common Stata commands optimized for large datasets
d 
d  ftools consists of a Mata file and several Stata commands: The
d Mata file creates identifiers (factors) from variables by using
d hash functions instead of sorting the data, so it runs in time
d O(N) and not in O(N log N). The Stata commands exploit this to
d avoid sort operations,  at the cost of being slower for small
d datasets (mainly because of the cost involved in moving data from
d Stata to Mata). Implemented commands are fcollapse, fegen group,
d and fsort. Note that most of the capabilities of levels and
d contract are already supported by these commands. Possible
d commands include more egen functions and merge and reshape
d alternatives.

U 57
d 'RANKTEST': module to test the rank of a matrix
d 
d  ranktest implements various tests for the rank of a matrix.
d Tests of the rank of a matrix have many practical applications.
d For example, in econometrics the requirement for identification
d is the rank condition, which states that a particular matrix must
d be of full column rank. Another example from econometrics
d concerns cointegration in vector autoregressive (VAR) models; the
d Johansen trace test is a test of a rank of a particular matrix.
d The traditional test of the rank of a matrix for the standard
d (stationary) case is the Anderson (1951) canonical correlations
d test. If we denote one list of variables as Y and a second as Z,
d and we calculate the squared canonical correlations between Y and
d Z, the LM form of the Anderson test, where the null hypothesis is
d that the matrix of correlations or regression parameters B
d between Y and Z has rank(B)=r, is N times the sum of the r+1
d largest squared canonical correlations. A large test statistic
d and rejection of the null indicates that the matrix has rank at
d least r+1. The Cragg-Donald (1993) statistic is a closely related
d Wald test for the rank of a matrix. The standard versions of
d these tests require the assumption that the covariance matrix has
d a Kronecker form; when this is not so, e.g., when disturbances
d are heteroskedastic or autocorrelated, the test statistics are no
d longer valid. ranktest implements various generalizations of
d these tests - Kleibergen-Paap, Cragg-Donald, and J-type 2-step
d GMM and CUE GMM tests - to the case of a non-Kronecker covariance
d matrix. The implementation in ranktest will calculate test
d statistics that are robust to various forms of
d heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation, and clustering.

d either draws its Generalised Lorenz curve or generates two new
d variables containing the Generalised Lorenz ordinates for x, i.e.
d GL(p) at each p = F(x) (or both). For a population ordered in
d ascending order of x, a graph of GL(p) against p plots the
d cumulative total of x divided by population size, against
d cumulative population share. GL(1) = mean(x). glcurve can also be

d curves and 'Three Is of Poverty' (TIP) curves, with appropriate
d definition of varname, order of cumulation (set with sortvar
d option), and normalisation (e.g. by the mean of varname). For

d 'PDSLASSO': module for post-selection and post-regularization OLS or IV estimation and inference
d 
d  pdslasso and ivlasso are routines for estimating structural
d parameters in linear models with many controls and/or
d instruments. The routines use methods for estimating sparse
d high-dimensional models, specifically the lasso (Least Absolute
d Shrinkage and Selection Operator, Tibshirani 1996) and the
d square-root-lasso (Belloni et al. 2011, 2014). These estimators
d are used to select controls (pdslasso) and/or instruments
d (ivlasso) from a large set of variables (possibly numbering more
d than the number of observations), in a setting where the
d researcher is interested in estimating the causal impact of one
d or more (possibly endogenous) causal variables of interest. Two
d approaches are implemented in pdslasso and ivlasso: (1) The
d "post-double-selection" (PDS) methodology of Belloni et al.
d (2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016). (2) The "post-regularization"
d (CHS) methodology of Chernozhukov, Hansen and Spindler (2015).
d For instrumental variable estimation, ivlasso implements
d weak-identification-robust hypothesis tests and confidence sets
d using the Chernozhukov et al. (2013) sup-score test. The
d implemention of these methods in pdslasso and ivlasso require the

d 
d  leebounds computes treatment effect bounds for samples with
d non-random sample selection/attrition as proposed by Lee (Review
d of Economic Studies, 2009). The lower and    upper bound,
d respectively, correspond to extreme assumptions about the missing
d information that are consistent with the observed data. As
d opposed to parametric approaches to correcting for sample
d selection bias, such as the classical Heckman (1979) estimator,
d Lee (2009) bounds rest on very few assumptions, i.e. random
d assignment of treatment and monotonicity. Monotonicity means that
d the treatment status affects selection in just one direction.
d That is, receiving a treatment makes selection either more or
d less likely for any observation. In technical terms, the approach
d rests on a trimming procedure. Either from below or from
d above, the group (treatment, control) that suffers less from
d sample attrition is trimmed at the quantile of the outcome
d variable that corresponds to the share of 'excess observations'
d in this group. Calculating group differentials in mean    outcome
d yields the lower and the upper bound, respectively, for the
d treatment effect depending on whether trimming is from below or
d above.  leebounds    assumes that it is unknown, a priori, which
d group (treatment, control) is subject to the higher selection
d probability and estimates this from data    (see Lee, 2009:1090). d

d 'MYLABELS': module for axis labels or ticks on transformed scales or for daily dates
d 
d  mylabels and myticks generate axis labels and ticks on
d transformed scales. Their use is best explained by example. You
d draw a graph and one axis is on a transformed square root scale.
d You wish the axis labels to show untransformed values. For some
d values this is easy; for example, ylabel(0 1 2 "4" 3 "9" 4 "16" 5
d "25") says use "4" as label for 2, and so forth. For other values
d and/or other transformations the conversion may be more difficult
d to do in your head. The idea behind mylabels is that you feed it
d the numeric labels you want shown and the transformation being
d used. It will then place the appropriate specification in a local
d macro which you name. You may then use that local macro as part
d of a later graphics command. The idea behind myticks is similar.
d  mydays displays a formatted list of specified days that lie
d within the range of a tsset daily date variable describing a time
d series and puts the numeric version of that list in a specified
d local macro. The result may be useful for specifying axis label
d or tick positions on graphs of time series. mydays requires Stata
d 9.0.

d 'MAT2TXT': module to write matrix to ASCII file
d 
d mat2txt outputs a Stata matrix to a text file for use in other
d programs such as word processors or spreadsheets.  The matrix row
d and column names as well as the matrix data values are exported
d to a tab delimited ASCII file. The user may optionally specify a
d title and/or a note to add text to the file before and/or after
d the matrix.  Display formats may be specified.  The data may be
d appended to an existing file or replace an existing file. The
d routine now handles matrix labels with spaces and long filenames. d
