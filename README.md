# repkit

This Stata module is package providing a utility toolkit
for reproducibility best-practices.
The motivation for this package is to make the World Bank's
reproducibility best-practices more accessible to a wider Stata community.
The best-practices promoted in this package appreciated
identified and implemented as part of the
[World Bank's reproducibility effort](https://reproducibility.worldbank.org/).

Currently, this toolkit has the following commands:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [repado](https://dime-worldbank.github.io/repkit/reference/repado.html) | Command used to manage project ado command dependencies. This command provides a way to make sure that all team members as well as future reproducers of the projects code use the exact same version of all command dependencies. |
| [repkit](https://dime-worldbank.github.io/repkit/reference/repkit.html) | Command named the same as the package. Most important purpose is that this command makes the code `which repkit` work. |
| [reprun](https://dime-worldbank.github.io/repkit/reference/reprun.html) | This command is used to automate reproducibility checks by running a do-file or a set of do-files and compare all state values (RNG-value, data signature etc.) between the two runs. This command is currently only release as a beta-version. |
